  "aboutme": `My two passions: computers and policy! I love to code and I love to think about pressing 
  global issues. How did I get here? I started my college career with an interest in international 
  relations. I took lots of exciting courses, learning about international security and gaining skills 
  in research and communication. I worked internships with the US Department of State, a Congressional office, 
  a California State Senatorâ€™s office, and a local nonprofit. At the same time, I encountered computer science 
  at Stanford. I realized I thoroughly enjoyed programming and learning about computer systems. I decided to 
  pursue further education in computer science, with the aim of starting a career as a developer, ideally in a 
  security- and policy-adjacent role. I look forward to seeing where these passions will take me in life!`,

      These attacks are an increasingly

      in Golang, we built up the system on multiple Linux virtual machines using a microservices architecture.
