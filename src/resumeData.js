      These attacks are an increasingly 
      concerning vulnerability that we do not yet have an effective means of tackling. Coding primarily 
      in Golang, we built up the system on multiple Linux virtual machines using a microservices architecture.
      I also analyzed the terabytes of data using BigQuery.`
